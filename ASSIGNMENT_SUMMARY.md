# Assignment 2 Summary: Unit Testing with Stubs and Drivers

## Student Submission Summary

### Assignment Completed: ✓

This submission includes complete implementations for both tasks with comprehensive testing.

---

## Task 1: Unit Testing with a Stub ✓

### Implementation Files

1. **ValidationService.java** (Interface)
   - Location: `src/main/java/com/testing/task1/ValidationService.java`
   - Defines contract for validating calculator operations

2. **Calculator.java** (Main Class)
   - Location: `src/main/java/com/testing/task1/Calculator.java`
   - Supports: add, subtract, multiply, divide operations
   - Uses ValidationService for operation validation
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

3. **ValidationServiceStub.java** (Stub)
   - Location: `src/test/java/com/testing/task1/ValidationServiceStub.java`
   - Returns fixed responses: allows only "add" and "subtract"
   - Demonstrates stub concept clearly

4. **CalculatorTest.java** (JUnit Tests)
   - Location: `src/test/java/com/testing/task1/CalculatorTest.java`
   - **15 comprehensive tests** including:
     - Valid operations (add, subtract)
     - Invalid operations (multiply, divide - rejected by stub)
     - Edge cases (null, empty, division by zero)
     - Case insensitivity and whitespace handling

### Key Features - Task 1
- ✓ Proper stub implementation with fixed responses
- ✓ Clean separation of concerns
- ✓ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✓ Well-documented code
- ✓ All edge cases handled

---

## Task 2: Unit Testing with Drivers ✓

### Implementation Files

1. **PaymentService.java** (Interface)
   - Location: `src/main/java/com/testing/task2/PaymentService.java`
   - Defines contract for payment processing

2. **InventoryService.java** (Interface)
   - Location: `src/main/java/com/testing/task2/InventoryService.java`
   - Defines contract for inventory checking

3. **ShoppingCart.java** (Main Class)
   - Location: `src/main/java/com/testing/task2/ShoppingCart.java`
   - Implements checkout logic: inventory check → payment processing
   - Returns true only if both checks pass
   - Comprehensive validation

4. **PaymentServiceDriver.java** (Driver)
   - Location: `src/test/java/com/testing/task2/PaymentServiceDriver.java`
   - Simulates payment processing
   - Configurable success/failure behavior
   - Detailed logging and state tracking

5. **InventoryServiceDriver.java** (Driver)
   - Location: `src/test/java/com/testing/task2/InventoryServiceDriver.java`
   - Simulates inventory checking
   - Configurable stock levels
   - Detailed logging and state tracking

6. **ShoppingCartTest.java** (JUnit Tests)
   - Location: `src/test/java/com/testing/task2/ShoppingCartTest.java`
   - **24 comprehensive tests** including:
     - Successful checkout scenarios
     - Insufficient inventory scenarios
     - Payment failure scenarios
     - Edge cases (negative values, null services, large amounts)
     - Driver behavior verification

### Key Features - Task 2
- ✓ Proper driver implementations with realistic behavior
- ✓ Configurable drivers for different test scenarios
- ✓ Detailed logging showing driver actions

- ✓ Follows Java naming conventions
- ✓ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✓ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✓ Proper encapsulation

### Error Handling
- ✓ Validates all input parameters
- ✓ Throws appropriate exceptions with clear messages
- ✓ Handles edge cases gracefully

---

## Edge Cases Handled ✓

### Task 1 Edge Cases
- ✓ Null operation parameter
- ✓ Empty operation string
- ✓ Invalid operations (rejected by stub)
- ✓ Division by zero
- ✓ Null validation service
- ✓ Case insensitivity
- ✓ Whitespace handling
- ✓ Zero operands

### Task 2 Edge Cases
